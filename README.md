# Take Home Project

Challenge: A directory contains multiple files and directories of non-uniform file and directory names. Create a program that traverses a base directory and creates an index file that can be used to quickly lookup files by name, size, and content type.

# Usage

The application was written in python programming language. The application "TakeHome1.py" when run in the terminal using the "python TakeHome1.py" command, you will be prompted to enter a keyword that best identifies with what you are searching for. The code can be retrofitted for any directory, one has to just change the base directory (base_dir) to the path of the directory to be indexed and searched.
The indexed file that indicates the Name, Size and Content-type of the test_data is generated in the index.json file. This file can be found in the test_data branch.

Thanks.
